### TODO add contribution guideline doc

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/stuboydl/mvsyntax/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/stuboydl/mvsyntax/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

<!-- - If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:
  * [**Active Record** (models, encryption, database) issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record.rb)
  * [**Active Record Migrations** issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record_migrations.rb)
  * [**Action View** (views, helpers) issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/action_view.rb)
  * [**Active Job** issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/active_job.rb)
  * [**Active Storage** issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/active_storage.rb)
  * [**Action Mailer** issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/action_mailer.rb)
  * [**Action Mailbox** issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/action_mailbox.rb)
  * [**Action Pack** (controllers, routing) issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/action_controller.rb)
  * [**Generic template** for other issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/generic.rb)

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting guidelines](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#reporting-an-issue).

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Before submitting, please read the guide [_TODO_] to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of syntaxes and grammars will generally not be accepted (read more about [our rationales behind this decision](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700)).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your change and start writing code

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes

* We generally reject changes to Active Support core extensions. Those change should be proposed in the [Ruby issue tracker instead](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues), as we don't want to conflict with future versions of Ruby.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question about how to use MV in the [mv forums](https://community.rocketsoftware.com/home).

#### **Do you want to contribute to this documentation?**

- Please read [Contributing to the mvsyntax Documentation](https://example.com)

MVSyntax is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join [the team](https://example.com)!

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
