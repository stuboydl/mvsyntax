## Using the license tool uvlictool

Use uvlictool to report on the current state of UniVerse licensing and to clean up current licensing. You must be a UniVerse Administrator to use uvlictool.

> Note: Starting at UniVerse 11.3.1, the IPv6 protocol is supported. IPv6 compatibility provides the ability to create more IP addresses, as IPv4 addresses are running out. In addition, IPv6 utilizes a more secure data package. However, UniVerse device licensing is not supported on IPv6 protocols at this time. If you are connected using an IPv6-only client, the uvlictool command displays 127.0.0.1 (localhost) as the IP address.

The **uvlictool** also does the following:

- Lists a report on license use at both the UniVerse and the package level.
- Identifies the process that owns the license, and lists package licenses it holds.
- Identifies the remote device holding the license. Applies to UniVerse 11.2.2 or earlier.
- On UNIX systems, uvlictool clean_lic -a cleans up the current licenses based on shared memory segments associated with dead processes. With this option, uvlictool scans the license table and releases any license associated with a pid that is not a valid UniVerse process. Applies to UniVerse 11.2.2 or earlier and 11.3.1 or later.
- On Windows platforms, uvlictool clean_lic -a cleans up the current licenses based on dead entries in the process table. With this option, uvlictool scans the license table and releases any license associated with a pid that is not a valid UniVerse process. Applies to UniVerse 11.2.2 or earlier and 11.3.1 or later.
- Recomputes license counts at the UniVerse, package, and seat levels. Applies to UniVerse 11.2.2 or earlier.

### Syntax

> uvlictool [check_acctlic] [list_acctlic] [ reload_acctlic] [report_lic [logical_account_name]] [clean_lic [-a]]

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
| check_acctlic | Checks the syntax of the $UVHOME/acct_licn.def file and reports any errors found.
| list_acctlic | Lists the current loaded account-based license and its usage.
| reload_acctlic | Reloads the $UVHOME/acct_licn.def file so that new definitions are applied.
| report_lic | Lists the current licensing state. Beginning at UniVerse 11.2.3, the report_lic parameter has been augmented with logical_account_name option. If the logical_account_name is specified, only the users in the specified logical group will be listed. |
| clean_lic | Cleans up the current licensing state. With this option, uvlictool scans the license table and releases any license associated with a pid that is not a valid UniVerse process. <br> `Note: This option was disabled at version 11.2.2, but is re-enabled starting at version 11.3.1. The uvcleanupd daemon performs the same function as the clean_lic option of uvlictool when it runs on its regularly scheduled interval.` |
| -a | Recomputes license counts at the UniVerse, package, and seat level. <br> `Note: This option was disabled at version 11.2.2, but is re-enabled starting at version 11.3.1. The uvcleanupd daemon performs the same function as the clean_lic option of uvlictool when it runs on its regularly scheduled interval.` |
